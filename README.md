# Average-Term-Length-By-Initial-Character-and-total-distance-of-the-pair
Program reads the given text file and preprocess the text according to following order: Tokenize the text by whitespace(not just space character, e.g.more than one space, tab, newline etc.), remove punctuations, and apply the lowercase. And than program calculates followings:
-Average Term Length By Initial Character:  It finds all words which start same letter and than calculates and adds the length of all words finally divide the this lenght with word's numbers
- Total Minimum Distance: Program chooses two word using set if pairs are equal each others then continue. After finding pairs calculates minimum distance between words using f(t 1) *f(t 2)/1+ln âˆ‘ d(t ,t ).
